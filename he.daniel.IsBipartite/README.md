A Java program that finds the shortest path between two points as well as whether or not a graph is bipartite.

## Program Structure
This program accomplishes the aboveformentioned task with the given graph class.

## Input
The user first enters a the name of a text file containing a graph. For example, if the name of the text file containing a graph is "bipartite.txt", simply enter bipartite.txt when prompted to do so. Afterwards, the user will be prompted for a starting and ending vertex. Enter the starting and ending vertex. Here is an example input and output, where the entered values are bipartite.txt, 2, and 0.

Enter the name of the input file: bipartite.txt   
Enter a starting vertex:
2
Enter an ending vertex: 
0
The shortest path is 2-5-0
Bipartite.
